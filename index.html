            <p>
              Celia St. James was the love of Evelyn Hugo’s life. Despite the
              societal pressures and personal challenges that kept them apart,
              their connection was undeniable and enduring. Evelyn and Celia
              shared a deep, passionate bond built on love, understanding, and
              forgiveness. Their relationship spanned decades of secrecy and
              sacrifice, with Evelyn ultimately prioritizing Celia’s happiness
              over societal expectations. Evelyn’s greatest regret was the time
              they lost, but their love remains the most defining part of her
              story.
